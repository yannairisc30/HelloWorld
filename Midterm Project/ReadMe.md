Midterm Project: Creating a Restaurant Blog of places that I have been.

Home: started page
Blog: Broken down into boroughs
Upnext: blog readers can see what restaurnts I will be going to next
About Us: Why did I choose to write about food, and a form where people can submit places they want me to try.


- The code below represents the html of my navigation bar.
 Here we can see how ther are 4 different options but only two of them have dropdown options which are the "blog" button the About Us button


<div class="navbar">
        <a href="../Home/home.html">Home</a>
        <!-- Blog dropdown -->
        <div class="dropdown">
            <button class="dropbtn">Blog
                <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i>
            </button>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <a href="#">Manhattan</a>
                <a href="#">Brooklyn</a>
                <a href="./Blog/all.html">All Post</a>
            </div>
        </div>
        <a href="../UpNext/upnext.html">UpNext</a>

        <!-- About dropdown -->
        <div class="dropdown">
            <button class="dropbtn">About
                <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i>
            </button>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <a href="../About/aboutOne.html">Why Food?</a>
                <a href="../About/aboutTwo.html">Any Request</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>


Next Steps: I want to continue developing this blog. My next steps would be to continue working on designing aspect of the website and also finish the other sections or subtabs. I would like to have a lot more detail on my Upnext page possibly just more detail to get the audience excited of the next places I would visit. Also working on my format is something that I would like to continue to do.
