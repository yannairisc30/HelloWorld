Midterm Project: Creating a Restaurant Blog of places that I have been.

Home: started page
Blog: Broken down into boroughs
Upnext: blog readers can see what restaurnts I will be going to next
About Us: Why did I choose to write about food, and a form where people can submit places they want me to try.


- The code below represents the html of my navigation bar.
 Here we can see how ther are 4 different options but only two of them have dropdown options which are the "blog" button the About Us button

 Next Steps: My next steps would be to continue working on my layout and to finish the rest of the pages. Specifically I want to go 
 into more details with my Upnext tab and my form.
