        <p>HELLO THANK YOU FOR READING MY BLOG! My Name is Yannairis Cruz but to make people's and 
            my life easier I just go by Yanni. I am from Dominican Republic where the food never dissappoints, 
            but was born and raised in New York City specfially Washington Heights where the food also never dissapoints 
            I have always loved food since I was a baby! When I was the age of 15 I began to love 
        to cook food, and the desire to taste different cuisine grew. This is where I started to look up places 
        I could go try and my love for food grew even more. 
        Right now I really enjoy going to different restaurnts but maybe one day I'll make my own "emphasis on the maybe". 
        I hope you enjoy my blog and feel free to reach out anytime! <br> Email: yc5185@nyu.edu</p>
